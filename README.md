# Simple Game Lobby System

Prompt: Develop a backend system that manages game lobbies for a multiplayer game. The system should allow players to create lobbies, join and leave lobbies, and start a game when all players are ready.

## Description

Of course, due to the nature of this project, and the time period I had available to complete it, it is very simple. However, I have made sure that it is functionable, clean and simple for the users to interact with.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Before using this system, ensure you have:
* Node.js (version 12.x or newer)

And:
* Socket.IO
* Express
  
Which will be automatically installed via NPM when setting up.

### Executing program

To run and use thist system you should do the following simple steps:
* Download the source folder
* Open this directory in your terminal, and run the following command:
```
node server.js
```
* Connect in your web browser by connecting to http://localhost:4000
* To connect on other devices, find the IP address of the machine you run the system with
* Then connect using other devices by connecting to http://--insert ip address--:4000
